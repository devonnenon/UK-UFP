### Mortality risks associated with short-term exposure to ultrafine particles in London and the West Midlands

------------------------------------------------------------------------

A reproducible example of a subset of the analysis published in this article that assesses the association between ultrafine air pollution and mortality:

Nenon D, Fuller G, Masselot P, Gasparrini, A. Mortality risks associated with short-term exposure to ultrafine particles in London and the West Midlands. *Environmental Epidemiology*. 2025. DOI:

The material:

<<<<<<< HEAD
-   *UFPdata* stores the original and cleaned UFP data from the Defra measurement sites in London and the West Midlands in the period 2000--2019.
-   The numbered files from *00_packages.R* to *08_plots.R* reproduce the steps of the analysis of non-accidental mortality and display the results.
-   *ufpmortality_data.csv* stores the daily time series data for UFP and non-accidental mortality in the two locations for the reproducible example.
-   *origcode* stores the original code for the full analysis in the paper. These are intended for reference only and are not reproducible.
